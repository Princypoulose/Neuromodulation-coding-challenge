I developed a form to capture patient details and their pain inventory responses using PHP, with Bootstrap utilized for design. jQuery is used to calculate the total score based on the user's pain inventory responses and to determine age from the provided date of birth.
For backend database support, I utilized SQL Server. To connect PHP to SQL Server, I installed necessary drivers such as PDO SQL Server and SQLSRV extensions. The process begins with user registration and login. If the user is already registered, they can log in directly. Once logged in, users can fill out the Neuromodulation Form. Additionally, an admin view is implemented to facilitate the management of user details. In the admin interface, administrators have the ability to view, edit, and delete user submissions, ensuring efficient data management and accessibility. To run this program, I configured PHP in my IIS server for deployment.
